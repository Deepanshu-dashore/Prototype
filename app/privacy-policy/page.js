                We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational

                safeguards, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
                information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
                secure.

              </h2>
              <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting
                you can activate to signal that you prefer privacy and do not
                want data about your online browsing activities to be monitored
                and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for
                recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised, and
                therefore we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals.
