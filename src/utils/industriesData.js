    fullDescription: `Nursing homes contain vulnerable members of our society and it is important that we do all we can to protect them. Having the proper procedures, practices and equipment in place will ensure that the residents at a nursing home are kept safe.

In order to reduce the risk of potential harmful particulates and outside contaminants entering a nursing home it's important to make sure you stop it right at the front door. Often hand sanitisers are the "go to" tool for reducing the spread of germs but many people often forget about the amount of contamination they bring in via the feet or wheels of trollies.

Recent studies have shown that over the space of a week a single pair of shoes can collect up to 440,000 units of bacteria. Having a proper contamination control mat in place ensures that 99.9% of all bacteria/harmful contaminants is removed from the sole of someone's foot before entering into an area. Our silver biocide ingredient is totally anti-microbial and is proven to kill 50+ organisms including MRSA & COVID-19.

Contamination control mats are the most effective way to reduce the spread of any harmful bacteria and contamination throughout a nursing home facility. Our contamination control mats all come with a 2-year replacement warranty and are also extremely easy to maintain and keep clean.

Not only are contamination control mats extremely easy to clean and maintain they can also last up to 5 years if they are maintained correctly. They are also a much cheaper option as well since they do not need to be replaced every few weeks in comparison to peel off matts.`,

    fullDescription: `Contamination is a major and growing concern in cleanrooms, critical areas and controlled environments of any semi-conductor facility. Although contamination from foot, wheel and airborne particles is often dismissed as simply 'dust' or 'dirt', the dangers it poses can be devastating. Contamination in the semi-conductor critical environment can have a major impact on quality, product yield, effectiveness and profitability.

Particles in a semi-conductor facility can be viable or non-viable, made from different materials, come from different places and travel large distances.

Particles outside the critical area can also be a potential problem, especially the small, light, invisible particles. Even fairly large particles that have settled on the floor are easily crushed into very small particles and redistributed back into the air. These airborne particles then get transferred into the critical area of your semi-conductor facility where they present a potential hazard.

According to a 3M study 80% of contaminants/harmful particulates enter the critical area of a semi-conductor environment via the feet or wheels of trollies. A contamination control mat supplied and installed by CC Matting will provide 99.9% protection from these harmful particulates over 6 falls of the feet.

The high tack contamination control mat is made of a polyester polymer with a polyester fabric backing. The properties of the cocktail of materials used in the sophisticated manufacturing process together create a material that has a very optically smooth, soft and supple surface with a natural tack and a high level of short-range electromagnetic forces, known as van der Waals forces.

These properties enable the surface to attract, collect and retain particles ranging in size from over 100 microns down to a few nanometres.

To enhance the performance of the material special additives are mixed in to give static dissipative and anti-microbial properties.

All CC Matting contamination control mats are totally non-volatile/non-toxic – which makes them suitable for any grade of area. Also, there is zero outgassing from our mats ensuring they are optimally suitable for use in any semiconductor facility.

The cutting edge polymer technology maximizes the reduction of particulate and static contamination from your critical environment. The contamination threat in the manufacturing process is greatly reduced from start to finished chips.

All of these properties combine to ensure that your semi-conductor facility is being optimally protected for both your staff and contractors alike. There is no other proven method in the world today that can remove 99.9% of potential harmful particulates/contaminants from the feet or wheels of trolleys.`,

Hospitals deal with very high levels of footfall throughout the day with visitors coming and going. Along with this high level of footfall brings the risk of outside infections and contaminants. These potentially dangerous contaminants can have devastating effects in a hospital environment and can potentially put lives at risk too.

This is why it's so important that you stop these risks right at the very front door before anyone even steps foot inside the facility. Contamination controls mats are the only proven method in the world today that can remove 99.9% of potential harmful particulates/contaminants from the feet or wheels of trolleys.
